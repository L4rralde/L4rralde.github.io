            I prepared this portfolio just for The Construct Sim, however, feel free to ask me

            DonkieTown is a mobile robotics platform designed to be affordable and scalable.
            The idea was to have a testbed with multiple intelligent cars driving at the same time
            while communicating their driving intentions and state variables as Intelligent Connected
            Vehicles alike. It was developed over
            <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> using python and C++.

            Before building the robots and bringing up the testbed, the driving software had to be designed first.
            I used Gazebo Sim to do such a task. Using Gazebo was also handy to perform some Software and 
            Hardware in the Loop testing and to get some performance statistics. In addition, I used Simulink for
            Kinematic Modelling, Controls, and Kalman Filters tunning.

            In 2023, for the very first time, a group of graduate students of Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas
            joined the Mexican Robotics Tournament and asked for my help. At that time, I was starting an on-site
            job at Intel in Guadalajara, i.e., I was in another city. To collaborate, we use an open Gazebo 
            project of the Parrot Bebop quadcopter and borrow 3 bebops for the competition. Thanks to gazebo,
            I could develop the base library for our autonomous driving software, and special-purpose software for
            some challenges. We finished 1st &#129470; in the competition in 2023, and we are getting ready for
            the next one!

            In college, during lockdown, I took a robotics class where I learned to model and control robotic arms.
            This project was part of my homework. I designed a 2 DoF arm with SolidWorks, exported it to
            Simulink via Simscape and also developed a Kinematic model. There were 2 objectives: (1) to test on my 
            model using Simscape's model as reference and (2) test different control algorithms for path following.
            Because I liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=1321s">3Blue1Brown's video on Fourier Series</a>,
            I took an n-terms Fourier composition of a picture of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier as desired path. 
            Since it was my homework, the video is in Spanish. My apologies.

            A local path planner based on a feedforward neural network trained with genetic algorithms
            and designed to run on a car-like robot called Autominy. To be honest, I did not develop
            the simulator. Shout-out to <a href="https://www.rovislab.com/">Rovis laboratory</a>, which
            released <a href="https://www.rovislab.com/gridsim.html">GridSim</a>. I just fixed some
            issues and wrote the code to get the Neural Network working for the AutoMiny.

            I am really intrigued by understanding Deep Learning. For the sake of that wondering, I took
            <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction">Hugging Face's course on Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>
            and I have been trying to code each algorithm (and others such as Monte Carlo Tree Search)
            from scratch. I display only the scenarios to prove to work. I can't tell if my other
            implementations work because I have been using an apple M1 chip for training.

            it is certainly worth mentioning. Please, go to <a href="https://github.com/L4rralde/ReinforcementLearning">my repo</a>
