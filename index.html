	    <p style="color:#d8dee9">Hello, my name is Emmanuel Larralde and this is my presentation page. Here you can find a brief description about my projects, even those I couldn't finished. I'm continuously working on this page while remembering my high school html courses so It will take a time until I add and update my recent projects.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#f9ae57"> PPA </h3>
    <p style="color:#d8dee9">
    PPA stands for "Polit√©cnicos Pro Alzheimer". PPA was not only a device to help caretakers monitoring people with dementia, but also an iniciative to take care of them. 
	</p>

	<p style="color:#d8dee9">
    This project began as a personal concern since my grandmother has been seriously affected by alzheimer and It was too difficult for me and my family to always take care of her. Alongside some high school classmates I developed a device that advice me and my family whether my grandmother was indoors. We tried with trackers and wearables, but they were highly dependant on batteries and, whenever my grandmom realized that somebody had put something in her, she always threw them away. Hence, we come up with a device that was "invisible" for her. 
	</p>
    
    <p style="color:#d8dee9">
    In 2017 my 2 classmates and I enrolled our device to Samsung's solve for tomorrow contest. PPA won the first place and received a financial sponsor, and we were invited to CES 2018. Unfortunately, we took different paths after graduating from High School and PPA couldn't advance anymore.

		<h3 style="color:#f9ae57">&#960stache</h3>

		<p style="color:#d8dee9">	&#960stache is a Single-Issue In-Order pipelined core based on the RV32I ISA subset. I started developing it for my first computer architecture class and it is composed of 5 different pipelined stages, a forwarding unit and a hazard unit. Unfortanately there's no branch predictor inside it, therefore, compilers must add No operations to make it useful. However, my intentions are to finish this core architecture in order to be custom-made for my needs on Digital Signal Processing within my FPGAs.
