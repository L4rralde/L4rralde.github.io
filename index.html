	    <p style="color:#d8dee9">Hello, my name is Emmanuel Larralde and this is my presentation page. Here you can find a brief description about my projects, even those I couldn't finish. I'm continuously working on this page by my own while being responsible of all concerned with my life... Hence, it will take time until I add and update my recent projects.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#f9ae57"> PPA </h2>
    <p style="color:#d8dee9">
    PPA stands for "Politécnicos Pro Alzheimer". PPA was not only a device to help caretakers monitoring people with dementia, but also an initiative to take care of them. 
	</p>

	<p style="color:#d8dee9">
    This project began as a personal concern since my grandmother has been seriously affected by alzheimer and It was too difficult for me and my family to always take care of her. Alongside some high school classmates I developed a device that used to warn me and my family whether my grandmother was indoors. We tried with trackers and wearables, but they were highly dependant on batteries and, whenever my grandmom realized that somebody had put something in her, she always threw them away. Hence, we came up with a device that was "invisible" for her. 
	</p>
    
    <p style="color:#d8dee9">
    In 2017 my 2 classmates and I enrolled our device in the Samsung solve for tomorrow contest. PPA won the first place and received a financial sponsor, and we were invited to CES 2018. Unfortunately, we took different paths after graduating from High School and PPA couldn't advance anymore.

		<h2><a href="https://github.com/L4rralde/Arquitectura-de-Procesadores" style="color:#f9ae57">&#960stache</a></h2>

		<p style="color:#d8dee9">	&#960stache is a Single-Issue In-Order pipelined core based on the RV32I ISA subset. I started developing it for my first computer architecture class and it is composed of 5 different pipelined stages, a forwarding unit and a hazard unit. Unfortunately there's no branch predictor inside it, therefore, compilers must add No Operations to make it useful. However, my intentions are to finish this core architecture in order to be custom-made for my needs on Digital Signal Processing within my FPGAs.
		</p>

		<p style="color:#d8dee9">	&#960stache was developed alongside Quartus Prime. It was intended to be loaded into a Cyclone IV E EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, I've only tested it in a RTL simulation by means of ModelSim Altera. The analysis and synthesis ensure the use of 1,076 total logic elements and a maximum clock frequency of 71.89 MHz is warranted by the timing analysis with a slow 1200mV 85C Model.

		<h2><a href="https://github.com/L4rralde/AutoMiny-Neurotrajectory" style="color:#f9ae57">AutoMiny Neurotrajectory</a></h2>
		<p style="color:#d8dee9">The <a href="https://autominy.github.io/AutoMiny/" style="color:#d8dee9">AutoMiny</a> is a 1:10-scale car-like robot from the Dahlem Center for Machine Learning. It was designed for education and research of self-driving cars. Fortunately, several robots from the Dahlem Center have been distributed to some universities and research centers around Mexico. In summer 2021, I adapted its driving software in order to be useful for a testbed which was designed at Centro de Investigación de Matemáticas A.C. in Zacatecas. The following video is a demo of the functionalities of an AutoMiny in our testbed while performing lane changing and overtaking for obstacle avoidance.</p>

		<p style="color:#d8dee9">
		My next step was to adapt a local planner, taken from ROVISlaboratory's <a href="https://www.rovislab.com/gridsim.html" style="color:#d8dee9"> Gridsim </a> simulator, driven by a Neural Network. Training was performed within GridSim using different use cases such as obstacles and traffic free roads, traffic free roads and roads with both traffic and static obstacles and alongside a genetic algorithm with thousands of generations of a population of 6 members each. The NN model was ported to AutoMiny's base driving software, but some ros packages were developed to emulate gridsim sensors with Lidar, pose and map information, drive speed and steering via the Neural Network, and to display the emulated sensor and the desired speed vector. You can get into the AutoMiny-Trajectory's repository by clicking on the subtitle in orange.

		<p style="color:#d8dee9" > Next video is a record of Neurotrajectory training and a test on a rosbag recorded from AutoMiny running the lane changing obstacle avoidance driving strategy from the first video. Unfortunately I no longer have access to the CIMAT Zacatecas' testbed, so I haven't had a chance to test it on a real AutoMiny</p>
