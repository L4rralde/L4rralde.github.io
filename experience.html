        <p>
            I'm open to any project involving embedded systems, algorithms, computer vision, robotics, and novel silicon.
            Including fellowships and assistantships. To be honest, I like the idea of becoming a graduate student.

        <h2>Hardware Engineer at Intel</h2>
        <p style="text-align:right"> March 2023-Today</p>
        <p>
            My performance as intern was good enough to be rehired as Hardware Engineer
            performing as a CPU Design Verification Engineer where I have been working
            on the design verification of a Branch Prediction Unit (BPU). I cannot elaborate, 
            but I'm using Python, SystemVerilog, C++ and GitHub on a regular basis.

        <h2>Technical Graduate Intern at Intel</h2>
        <p style="text-align:right"> Jan 2022-Jan 2023 </p>
        <p>In 2021 I was looking for my first job and my target was Intel. In college I had written 
            a lot of Verilog and Vhdl code for FPGAs, including 2 different CPU microarchitectures, so I
            wanted to corporately work on presilicon design. Finally, I was hired at Intel with a one-year
            contract performing as Presilicon Engineering Intern. In my internship, I worked on the design
            verification of the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-quick-assist-technology-overview.html
            ">Quick Assist Technology</a> for <a href=https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-xeon-granite-rapids-d-to-come-in-two-variants> Granite Rapids D</a>.

        <h2>Software Robotics Intern at CIMAT</h2>
        <p style="text-align:right"> Aug 2022-Feb 2023 </p>
        <p>
            Since I graduated from a public University, I had to work for 6 months in a public institution.
            <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/?lang=en">CIMAT</a> or Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (Research Center in Mathematics) is a public research center 
            member of <a href="https://conahcyt.mx/">CONAHCyT</a> (National Council of Science and Technology). At CIMAT, I worked on building a testbed, enabling robotics
            platforms such as <a href="https://autominy.github.io/AutoMiny/">AutoMiny</a>, ran <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> Workshops and collaborated with graduate students.
            To be honest, I really enjoyed my time at CIMAT.
