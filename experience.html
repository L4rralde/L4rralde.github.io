        <h2>CPU Design Verification Engineer at Intel</h2>
        <p style="text-align:right"> Feb 2023-Today</p>
        <p>
            My performance as intern was good enough to be rehired as 
            a CPU Design Verification Engineer where I have been working on the
            design verification of a Branch Prediction Unit (BPU). My team have been
            developing an impressive simulation software of this BPU from the scratch. I cannot elaborate, but
            I'm using Python, SystemVerilog, C++ and GitHub on a regular basis.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
            I have learned a lot in this role and my computer science skills have got an incredible boost:
            CI/CD, x86 computer (micro)architecture, assembly and Intel's software model, algorithms and data structures, design patterns, and even Deep Learning and Machine Learning Engineering.
            Shout-out to the AI experts at Intel who have started an internal AI program which I have been enrolled twice.
            I took the Deep Learning class (2023), earning this <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/3be10f52-5063-4e48-a77a-4b6d5e534669/linked_in_profile">badge</a>.
            Now (2024), I am a student of the Machine Learning Engineering class.

        <h2>Technical Graduate Intern at Intel</h2>
        <p style="text-align:right"> Jan 2022-Jan 2023 </p>
        <p>In 2021 I was looking for my first job and my target was Intel. In college I had written 
            a lot of Verilog and Vhdl code for FPGAs, including 2 different CPU microarchitectures, so I
            wanted to corporately work on presilicon design. Finally, I was hired at Intel with a one-year
            contract performing as Presilicon Engineering Intern. In my internship, I worked on the design
            verification of the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-quick-assist-technology-overview.html
            ">Quick Assist Technology</a> of <a href=https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-xeon-granite-rapids-d-to-come-in-two-variants> Granite Rapids D</a>.

        <h2>Robotics Software Engineering Intern at CIMAT</h2>
        <p style="text-align:right"> Aug 2022-Feb 2023 </p>
        <p>
            Since I graduated from a public University, I had to work for 6 months in a public institution.
            <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/?lang=en">CIMAT</a> or Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (Research Center in Mathematics) is a public research center 
            member of <a href="https://conahcyt.mx/">CONAHCyT</a> (National Council of Science and Technology). At CIMAT, I worked on building a testbed, enabling robotics
            platforms such as <a href="https://autominy.github.io/AutoMiny/">AutoMiny</a>, ran <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> Workshops and collaborated with graduate students.
