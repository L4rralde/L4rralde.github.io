            DonkieTown is a mobile robotics platform designed to be affordable and scalable.
            The idea was to have a testbed with multiple intelligent cars driving at the same time
            while communicating their driving intentions and state variables as Intelligent Connected
            Vehicles alike. It was developed over
            <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> using python and C++.

            Before building the robots and bringing up the testbed, the driving software had to be designed first.
            I used Gazebo Sim to do such a task. Using Gazebo was also handy to perform some Software and 
            Hardware in the Loop testing and to get some performance statistics. In addition, I used Simulink for
            Kinematic Modelling, Controls, and Kalman Filters tunning.

            &#960stache is a Single-Issue In-Order pipelined core based on the RV32I
            (<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> 32-bits Integer Instructions) ISA subset.
            I started developing it for my first computer architecture class and it is composed
            of 5 different pipelined stages, a forwarding unit, and a hazard unit.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
		<p>
            &#960stache was intended to be loaded into a Cyclone IV E EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA. 
            The analysis and synthesis ensure the use of 1,076 total logic elements and 
            a maximum clock frequency of 71.89 MHz is warranted by the timing analysis
            with a slow 1200mV 85C Model.

            In 2023, for the very first time, a group of graduate students of Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas
            joined the Mexican Robotics Tournament and asked for my help. At that time, I was starting an on-site
            job at Intel in Guadalajara, i.e., I was in another city. To collaborate, we use an open Gazebo 
            project of the Parrot Bebop quadcopter and borrow 3 bebops for the competition. Thanks to gazebo,
            I could develop the base library for our autonomous driving software, and special-purpose software for
            some challenges. We finished 1st &#129470; in the competition in 2023!

            I am really intrigued by understanding Deep Learning. For the sake of that wondering, I took
            <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction">Hugging Face's course on Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>
            and I have been trying to code each algorithm (and others such as Monte Carlo Tree Search)
            from scratch. I display only the scenarios to prove to work. I can't tell if my other
            implementations work because I have been using an apple M1 chip for training.
        </p>

            Actually, I think this adds little to this portfolio of mine, but I think
            it is certainly worth mentioning. Please, go to <a href="https://github.com/L4rralde/ReinforcementLearning">my repo</a>
            to explore more about this one.

        <p>
            Politécnicos Pro Alzheimer was a smart mat originally made to track my grandmother.
            She has Alzheimer and at that time she used to get lost. In High School, my classmates 
            and I created PPA, we won the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow contest and won an invitation
            to the Consumer Electronics Show 2018 and a grant to develop our prototype. I started college
            networking with private health care institutions and Startup accelerators.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
            I was 18-20 years old when I received most of the responsibilities, and
            since I was also new in Mexico City, PPA could not succeed.
