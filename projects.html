        <h2>DonkieTown</h2>
        <p>
            DonkieTown is a mobile robotics platform designed to be affordable and scalable.
            The idea was to have a testbed with multiple intelligent cars driving at the same time
            while communicating their driving intentions and state variables as Intelligent Connected
            Vehicles alike. It still is my most complex project so far. It was developed over
            <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> using python and C++. For the deployment, I developed
            bash scripts. Its driving software is powered by Extended Kalman Filters, classic control,
            FSMs, and Deep Learning. All running on an onboard Jeston Nano &#128568;.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
            I almost forgot to mention, I designed and built each robot, a tracking system, and a
            Vehicle-to-Vehicle implementation of an international specification.

        <h2>Politécnicos Pro Alzheimer (PPA)</h2>
        <p>
            Politécnicos Pro Alzheimer was a smart mat originally made to track my grandmother.
            She has Alzheimer and at that time she used to get lost. In High School, my classmates 
            and I created PPA, we won the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow contest and won an invitation
            to the Consumer Electronics Show 2018 and a grant to develop our prototype. I started college
            networking with private health care institutions and Startup accelerators.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
            I was 18-20 years old when I received most of the responsibilities, and
            since I was also new in Mexico City and enrolled to a time demanding
            degree, PPA could not succeed.

        <h2>&#960stache</h2>
        <p>
            &#960stache is a Single-Issue In-Order pipelined core based on the RV32I
            (<a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> 32-bits Integer Instructions) ISA subset.
            I started developing it for my first computer architecture class and it is composed
            of 5 different pipelined stages, a forwarding unit, and a hazard unit.
            Unfortunately, there is no branch predictor inside it, therefore, compilers must add
            No Operations to make it useful. However, I intend to finish this core architecture
            to be custom-made for my needs on Digital Signal Processing within my FPGAs.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
		<p>
            &#960stache was developed alongside Quartus Prime. It was intended to be loaded into
            a Cyclone IV E EP4CE115F29C7 FPGA. The analysis and synthesis ensure the use of 1,076
            total logic elements and a maximum clock frequency of 71.89 MHz is warranted by the
            timing analysis with a slow 1200mV 85C Model.
